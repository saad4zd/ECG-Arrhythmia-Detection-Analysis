# ECG Arrhythmia Detection Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring electrocardiogram (ECG) data for arrhythmia detection. The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset obtained from PhysioNet, titled "A large scale 12-lead electrocardiogram database for arrhythmia study".

## Introduction

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide valuable insights into heart health, offering a window into cardiac rhythm and potential abnormalities. Arrhythmias, irregular heart rhythms, can be indicative of underlying cardiovascular conditions, making their early detection crucial for timely intervention and patient care.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the ["A large scale 12-lead electrocardiogram database for arrhythmia study"](https://physionet.org/content/ecg-arrhythmia/1.0.0/) available on PhysioNet. It contains ECG recordings from individuals with various cardiac conditions, including atrial fibrillation (afib), supraventricular tachycardia (gsvt), sinus bradycardia (sb), and normal sinus rhythm (sr). Each recording consists of 12 leads, providing comprehensive cardiac electrical activity data.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis encompasses several key steps:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Downloading the dataset, familiarizing with its format, handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applying techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the high dimensionality of the ECG data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the distribution of heart rate and other relevant features, checking for correlations between different features, and exploring differences between patients with and without arrhythmias.
4. **Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations showcasing the distribution of heart rate and other relevant features, and visualizing data points from patients with and without arrhythmias in the lower-dimensional space obtained from dimensionality reduction.

5. **Reporting:** Summarizing findings in a Medium blog post, discussing the chosen dimensionality reduction technique, the results of EDA, and the significance of visualizations.
